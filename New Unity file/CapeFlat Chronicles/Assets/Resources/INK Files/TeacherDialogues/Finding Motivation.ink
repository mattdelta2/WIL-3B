    -> Future_Motivation

* Honestly, I struggle to find motivation most days.
    -> Struggle_Motivation

= Family_Motivation
Teacher: Family can be a powerful source of motivation. Keep their support close and use it to push through tough times.
-> END

= Future_Motivation
Teacher: Imagining a better future is an excellent motivator. The more you work towards it, the clearer that vision will become.
-> END

= Struggle_Motivation
Teacher: It’s okay to struggle. You’re not alone, and many people feel the same way. Have you tried setting smaller, achievable goals to get started?

* I’ve thought about it, but it feels pointless sometimes.
    -> Pointless_Goals

* Maybe I should give that a try.
    -> Give_Try
