 Managing expectations is important, both those you set for yourself and those others set for you. How do you feel about the expectations people have for you?

* I think they expect too much from me.
    -> Too_Much_Expectation

* I think they’re reasonable, but it’s hard to keep up.
    -> Reasonable_But_Hard

* I don’t think people expect much from me at all.
    -> Low_Expectations

= Too_Much_Expectation
Teacher: It can be overwhelming when people expect a lot from you. Have you talked to anyone about how you’re feeling?

* No, I don’t think they’d understand.
    -> Dont_Think_Understand

* I tried, but they told me I needed to work harder.
    -> Told_To_Work_Harder

= Dont_Think_Understand
Teacher: Sometimes we think people won’t understand, but they might surprise you. It’s worth trying to communicate how you’re feeling.
-> END

= Told_To_Work_Harder
Teacher: That can be tough to hear, especially when you’re already trying your best. Remember, you can only do what you’re capable of—don’t push yourself beyond your limits.
-> END

= Reasonable_But_Hard
Teacher: It’s good that you see the expectations as reasonable, even if they’re challenging. What helps you stay motivated to meet them?

* I try to focus on one thing at a time.
    -> Focus_On_One_Thing

* I remind myself why it’s important.
    -> Remind_Importance

= Focus_On_One_Thing
Teacher: Breaking things down into smaller tasks can make them more manageable. That’s a great strategy—keep it up.
-> END

= Remind_Importance
Teacher: Reminding yourself why something matters is a powerful motivator. Keeping the bigger picture in mind will help you get through the tough times.
-> END

= Low_Expectations
Teacher: When people don’t expect much, it can feel disheartening. But remember, you set your own expectations. What do you expect from yourself?

* I expect to do better than people think I can.
    -> Expect_To_Do_Better

* I’m not sure. I don’t really have expectations for myself.
    -> No_Self_Expectations

= Expect_To_Do_Better
Teacher: That’s the spirit. Defy the expectations others set for you. Show them—and yourself—what you’re capable of.
-> END

= No_Self_Expectations
Teacher: It’s important to set expectations for yourself, even if they’re small. Start by setting one simple goal and working towards it.
-> END
